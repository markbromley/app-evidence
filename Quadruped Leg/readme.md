# Quadruped Robot Leg with New Motors

Newly fitted quadruped robot leg. Previous iteration with expensive T-motor drone motors replaced with cheap unbranded drone motors. Next stage to wire back up to the motor controller + position encoders, before load testing to see if the new motors will be able to take the expected mass of the whole robot.
