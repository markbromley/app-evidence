# 8-Bit Clock and Register

Demonstration shows a single bit change to an 8 bit input (yellow LEDs on left). The memory register is then set to load. The input (10111111) is then transferred over to the memory register (state shown in red LEDs) on the next clock cycle (cycle high shown by blue LED). The output of the register is then shown again (yellow LEDs).
